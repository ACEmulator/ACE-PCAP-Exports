The three bars at the top of the screen show your Health, Stamina, and Mana (magical energy).

If you run out of Stamina, your attacks will be weak. If you run out of Mana, you will not be able to cast spells. If you run out of Health, you will die!

All three will replenish themselves in time, but there are ways to make this process faster.

Your character will be resurrected immediately at the last lifestone you used or at the last location where  you started the game, but will leave behind one or more items and half the pyreals in your Inventory.

When your character dies and is resurrected, your Vitae (lifeforce) is temporarily drained, reducing your secondary attributes (Health, Stamina, and Mana) and skills. As you earn more experience, your Vitae will be restored gradually. While your Vitae is reduced, you will see a yellow and red starburst in the upper-right corner of the game screen.
