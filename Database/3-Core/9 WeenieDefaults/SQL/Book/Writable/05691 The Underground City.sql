Yet, the more I reflected, the more it seemed somehow fitting that I should be the one to write about the vast halls known as the "Underground City."  I have a private name for it: "Thorsten Cragstone''s Tomb."  However, he himself always called it the Underground City, even when only seven of us lived there!

So, then, here I will write for you the story of the Underground City.

Olthoi had been following our scent for days, and we had crossed the river in the hopes of confusing them.  Soon after, it was Thorsten who spotted a portal in the distance.  Together, we plotted how we would lay our scent trails to confuse the Olthoi.  After hours of painstaking back-tracking, all seven of us slipped into the portal, and we found ourselves on an island that we ascertained to be in the middle of Olthoi Lake.

Here on the island, protected on all sides by water, we would be safe, finally, from Olthoi patrols.  Now we could rest, gather our strength, and plan for the future.

We soon set about exploring the island.  That is when we found yet another portal amidst the trees.  Hesitantly, Thorsten and I entered.  We came out in a vast, cool, dark hall.

With growing excitement, we set about exploring the corridors.  Even the darkest corners seemed to leap up with joy to see our torchlight.

Room after room we found, complete with still-usable remnants of simple tables, beds, chairs; we found cooking areas and dining areas, and halls wide enough to keep livestock.

Thorsten could hardly contain his joy when we were at last satisfied that no other living creature moved within.  "An underground city!" he shouted.  "A new capital for free humans, from where we can plot the overthrow of the Olthoi!"

Our numbers slowly grew, for we would sneak back to the mainland in search of other escaped slaves, then bring them back with us.  In the City, we repaired the furniture that we found, or made our own. 

We explored the halls and gathered what weapons and tools we could.  We stockpiled food and weapons.  We trained our people in warfare.  We began making plans.

We spun illusory dreams about us as we talked: dreams of green pastures and running water, sturdy houses built upon sunlit hills...and the walls of the Underground City seemed almost to lean toward us as if listening, as if delighted to hear the sounds of life and hope once more.

Thorsten''s body we brought back to the Underground City, which for so long had been our shelter, fortress, and home.  The coffin we laid in a chamber fit for a king''s final resting place.

For awhile, it was almost such.  But I was, in the end, wrong.  Few who remembered the horror of Olthoi enslavement wanted to continue living underground.  

And once a few houses had been built upon the land, under the bright sky, and once I had slept in a bed by a window and had awoken to sunlight upon my face, I knew that I, too, could no longer live in the darkness.

Long days have passed since then, since Thorsten''s passing...

Olthoi Lake is now known as Lake Blessed; the island is now called the Isle of Tears.  Thorsten even has a town named for him, right on the shores of Lake Blessed.  But it still pains me when I hear of what has become of his burial place, the Underground City.

And so it is even now.  Some people have asked my leave to try to live there, but most of them have since given up.  I believe a handful still survive there, but I have not had the liberty to go see for myself.  Indeed, I am too busy tending to other matters: the affairs of state, of a land of rolling green pastures and running water, of sturdy houses built upon sunlit hills.

Finally, I say to you: seek the City out if you wish to; bow in respect at Thorsten Cragstone''s tomb.  Remember the sacrifices of the past,  but more importantly, remember the promises of the future.
