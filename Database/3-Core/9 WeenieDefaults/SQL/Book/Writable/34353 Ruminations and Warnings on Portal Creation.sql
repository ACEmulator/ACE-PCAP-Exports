Coincidentally, in fetching the last inactive golem from Metos''s workshop, I find that he has three workshops located on three ley lines. Attuning my ritual to these three locations should be relatively trivial and work well.

I believe that three locations in the north are also of necessity. Otherwise, there is no central point. However, introducing three more locations may disrupt some of the power I am attempting to harness This must be addressed.

To mitigate this, I can change the intervals of the chant of the ritual. I had planned on three seconds pause between each invocation, but instead, if I reduce the interval to its square root, it will lend the correct amount of control over the ritual. As a reference for myself, the square root of three is 1.73205080756887729352744634, approximately enough for my purposes.
