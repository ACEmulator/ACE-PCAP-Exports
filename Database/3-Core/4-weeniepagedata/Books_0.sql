However, after recent conversations with Dobblar, I have come to wonder if perhaps we are being too conservative. After some research, I have come to find some ways in which mucor may be combined with various other materials.

It began when Dobblar first mentioned the practice of salvaging raw materials from weapons and armor that fallen foes may carry. This is not a practice that the Burun have previously pursued, as the bone and stone that we primarily use is plentiful. Dobblar happened to have a small sample of granite, mahogany, and opal with him for me to examine and attempt to craft with.

The materials are able to deal with the magics of the mucor without disintegrating, as long as one is reasonably careful. At that point, the mucor and the material are irrevocably bound together. In addition, the salvaged material may no longer be used normally, nor may the mucor - the two meld to together.

I believe that one may use normal magic item tinkering or weapon tinkering to combine these unique salvaged materials with the sorts of weapons that we Burun favor. Speak to Dobblar and purchase a basic Burun weapon, and then apply the mucor-altered salvaged material directly to the weapon. They should combine successfully. The following salvaged materials should work, if you are skilled enough:

Lady Elleina''s loss in Shendolain was perhaps a blessing, though it cost us many of Aerfalle''s valuable rock-boned troops. Elleina was a liability, unreliable and vain.

a magical artifact of uncertain origin, lay shattered at the flaming heart of Frore. With its destruction, warmth returned to the world.

Here Abrim of Morningthaw recounts the perils he and Kyoujin faced in the bowels of the lost city.

Without your sacrifice, we should have faced a still, cold doom. Your names shall be held in honor forevermore, the first champions of a new era in Dereth.

Muldaveus and I have become aware of a possible new ally that has found its way to Dereth.

Furthermore, Asheron''s research has led to the idea that it''s possible to construct a crystal that would have the power to trap Bael''Zharon within it.
