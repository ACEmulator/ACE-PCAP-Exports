This scripts found in this folder and any subfolders herein are generated from the PCAP files provided by the AC community in the final month of its retail life.
Most of these PCAP files were created with [aclog](https://github.com/tfarley/aclog) with the remaining being manually recorded using Wireshark or other network logging tools.

The tool used to generate these files can be currently found at [LtRipley36706/aclogview:Export-To-ACE-World-v4](https://github.com/LtRipley36706/aclogview/tree/Export-To-ACE-World-v4)
